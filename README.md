# groupProject

## Summary
We were tasked with making a copy of an existing website using Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS. Out of the options we chose to emulate techtalent.com. This is our first project working together with much more to come. Learning is a journey that never ends, and any, any, opportunity to apply knowledge and practice is beneficial.
